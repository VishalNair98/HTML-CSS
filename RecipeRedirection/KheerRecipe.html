    <p>Seviyaan kheer is also a good option  for a potluck dinner during festivals or get-together.<br>
    It can be made in big quantities.<br> 
    It can also be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.<br>
    I had made this kheer during our Diwali potluck dinner with our friends here at Sydney.<br>
    It was enjoyed by all.</p><br>
